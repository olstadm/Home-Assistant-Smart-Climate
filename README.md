## üöÄ Recent Enhancements

The dashboard has been completely redesigned to improve user experience and make climate intelligence more digestible. The enhanced Python script provides comprehensive sensors that power this intuitive interface.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Comfort Scoring**: Live comfort metrics combining temperature and humidity
- **Energy Efficiency Tracking**: Smart efficiency scoring based on HVAC usage and conditions  
- **Visual Comfort Band**: Interactive temperature chart with highlighted comfort zones
- **Proactive HVAC Timing**: Smart recommendations for when to start/stop heating and cooling
- **12-Hour Temperature Forecasting**: Predictive modeling for both idle and controlled scenarios

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Enhanced User Interface
- **Prominent Status Display**: Current HVAC recommendations and comfort metrics at the top
- **Visual Temperature Forecast**: Interactive chart with comfort zone highlighting
- **Quick Access Insights**: Fast temperature checkpoints (+30min, +1hr, +3hr)
- **Smart Timing Alerts**: Proactive notifications about temperature limits
- **Organized Configuration**: Logical grouping of settings and model parameters

### Improved Information Architecture
1. **Status Overview** - Current recommendation and live comfort metrics
2. **Forecast Visualization** - Enhanced chart with comfort band highlighting
3. **Quick Insights** - Fast access to key timing information  
4. **Configuration** - Settings and model learning status

## üß† Smart Features

### Comfort Score (0-100%)
Combines temperature (70% weight) and humidity (30% weight) to provide real-time comfort assessment:
- Temperature comfort zone based on your heating/cooling limits
- Humidity comfort zone (30-60% RH optimal)
- Real-time scoring helps optimize your environment

### Energy Efficiency Score (0-100%)
Evaluates system efficiency based on:
- Temperature differential between indoor/outdoor
- Current HVAC action (idle, heating, cooling)
- Solar conditions for natural heating assistance
- Helps identify optimal operation times

### Predictive Intelligence
- **Time-to-Limit**: Predicts when temperature will reach comfort boundaries
- **Optimal Start Times**: Recommends when to begin heating/cooling
- **Energy-Aware Scheduling**: Considers weather patterns and solar gain
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Monitors and improves prediction quality over time
